# Linkforge

Linkforge is a URL shortener project written in Go.

It currently supports Base62 encoding and decoding, link creation and validation, and in-memory storage.

Build:

go build ./...

Run:

go run ./cmd/linkforge https://example.com https://go.dev

## Shortener Service

The Shortener service provides operations for creating, resolving,
listing, and deleting short links.

It supports custom aliases, link expiration, and cursor-based pagination.
Links are stored using the Store interface with an in-memory implementation.

## Testing

Run all tests:

```bash
go test ./...
```

## Layout

```
cmd/      linkforge         demo binary — creates and prints shortened links
          linkctl           operator CLI   — prints its version, nothing more

pkg/                        reusable libraries — a separate Go module
  shortid/  Generator       collision-resistant code issuing           M4
  cache/    Cache[K,V]      bounded cache on the redirect hot path     M4

  link/     Store           link persistence, declared by its consumer M1 / M7
            Shortener       the domain service behind every transport  M2
  click/    Ingester        non-blocking submission from the hot path  M5
            Store           append-only raw event persistence          M7
            Aggregator      time series and top-N queries              M5
            Publisher       fan-out to live WebSocket subscribers      M9

            Verifier        token validation for middleware            M9
            UserStore       account persistence                        M7
  transport/Server          uniform listener lifecycle                 M6 / M8
  config/   Loader          environment-only configuration             M3
  observability/Metrics     counters and histograms                    M10
```

The `pkg/` tree is a second module so that reusable libraries stay free of any dependency on application code; `go.work` ties the two together for local development.

## Design rules

These hold for every milestone.

1. **Interfaces are declared by the consumer.** `link.Store` lives in `internal/link` because the shortener is what needs it — not beside any implementation. Constructors return concrete types.
2. **The dependency arrow points inwards.** `internal/link` and `internal/click` may not import a transport or a storage package.
3. **Analytics never blocks a redirect.** `Ingester.Submit` drops events under saturation rather than applying backpressure.
4. **Every listener shares one lifecycle contract**, which is what makes a single coordinated graceful shutdown possible.

## Working on it

```bash
make            # vet, lint and test — the same gates CI runs
make build
make test
make cover
make bench
make tidy
```

Requires Go 1.25+. Linting uses [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run) (`brew install golangci-lint`).

| # | Lessons | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| M0 | 1 | Toolchain, module layout, CI |
| M1 | 2–3 | base62 codec, `Link` model, in-memory store |
| M2 | 4–5 | Methods, interfaces, generics, error values |
| M3 | 6–7 | Files and `context`, CLI, `slog`, tests |
| M4 | 8–9 | Own hash table, LRU, trie, top-N heap |
| M5 | 10–11 | Ingestion pipeline, worker pool, synchronisation |
| M6 | 12–13 | TCP resolver, graceful shutdown, Docker |
| M7 | 14 | PostgreSQL and MongoDB stores |
| M8 | 15–16 | `net/http` first, then a framework; REST and Swagger |
| M9 | 17–19 | Validation, JWT and middleware, WebSockets |
| M10 | 20–21 | Production hardening and project defence |
